#Top Down Design: Mad Libs Final Project

#Main function
    #creates GUI
    #asks user to select which story or quit
    #once a story is selected, the mad lib creator class will be called
    #feeds in the parameters of where the word cloud words should be placed

#Create a mad lib class:
    #asks for the story file and the file of the kinds of missing words
    #gets user input (or random gen input)
    #puts the user input into the story
    #outputs the created story
    #takes the parameters for the word cloud words
    #outputs the words as randomly as I want them to be

#Create a random word class:
    #reads in text files of different kinds of words
    #figures out the type of word necessary
    #returns a random one of that type
    #is called by the mad lib creator class
